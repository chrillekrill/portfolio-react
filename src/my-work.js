      <p>I have studied Java before I started studying front end. Back when I did that I made a quiz program
     for someone who studies to become an electrician. So I have knowledge from more than one programming languange</p>

     <p>Here are two sample pictures of the quiz I made</p>

     <img src={require('./Pictures/quizquestion.png')} className="picture" alt="Picture of the first question in my quiz game"/>
